Guardian Latest Stories Flat
============================

Flat look for the latest 20 Guardian stories

Code running here: http://revdancatt.github.com/CAT514-guardian-latest-stories-flat/

Con't quite remember why I wrote this, I think I was getting fed up of not being able to
easily find links to the latest stories. This was about the minimum I could do to pretty it
up from being just a simple list.

TODO
====

1. Tweek the style away from current look a bit
2. Add some header and footer info
3. Add link back to Guardian Open Platform
